# SearchWithMyBrowser

Since April 28ᵗʰ 2016, Cortana opens searches only in Microsoft Edge to prevent users from using another search engine than Bing.  
SearchWithMyBrowser is a little utility that associates itself with the `microsoft-edge:` protocol, used by Cortana to open Edge. After parsing the request to make sure it's a valid URL, it will redirect it to your default browser.

## Donating

If you like my work, you are more than welcome to [donate](https://PayPal.me/CharlesMilette).

## Installing the program

Head over to the [releases section](https://github.com/charlesmilette/SearchWithMyBrowser/releases) to download the latest version. Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the instructions.  
If for any particular reason you need to test an executable you builded yourself, you can either make the same registry entries than the installer or just overwrite the file created by the installer.

## Building the program

Note to users: It is not required to build the program anymore. See precedent section for installation instructions.  

Optional dependencies:
- [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) - To build the installer.
- [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk), version 10.0.14393 or higher - To build the store package.

If you decided to build the installer, make sure that `ISCC.exe` is in your path. If you decided to build the store package, make sure that `makeappx.exe` is in your path.  
To build the whole project (including the installer and the store package), run the `Make.cmd` file at the root of the repository. You can also build subcomponents individually by running the `Make.cmd` file present in their subfolder.
